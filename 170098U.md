# Blockchain concepts

## Distributed Ledger
All the transactions that happen on the blockchain network are recorded in the distributed ledger. It is collaboratively maintained by the participants of the network via replications. Also, the information recorded here are immutable (already recorded transactions cannot be updated.) and only new transactions can be appended. 

## Smart Contracts
Smart contracts enforce the business logic in handling the transactions that all the network participants have to agree upon. This will support consistent update of information and controlled access on the ledger. Smart contracts can be used to ensure the transparency and traceability of the executed transactions.
